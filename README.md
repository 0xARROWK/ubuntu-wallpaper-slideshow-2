Fisrt, you need to clone this repository :

```bash
if pgrep -f "wallpaper_scheduler.py" &>/dev/null; then
    python3 /absolute/path/to/your/ubuntu-wallpaper-slideshow/folder/synchronize_terminal.py
else
    nohup python3 /absolute/path/to/your/ubuntu-wallpaper-slideshow/folder/wallpaper_scheduler.py >/dev/null 2>&1 &
